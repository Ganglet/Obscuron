## What this is

Most sequenced microbial genes have no functional annotation, because annotation is normally assigned by similarity to something already known, and for a huge share of genes nothing similar has ever been characterised. Obscuron scores each such "dark matter" sequence with a calibrated novelty score — an extreme-value-theory (EVT) tail p-value over kNN distance in a protein-language-model embedding — and validates it *retrospectively*: freeze a reference database at an earlier snapshot, score what was dark then, and grade those scores against a later snapshot in which some of those sequences have since been characterised. The headline, full-scale result: **held-out-family AUROC of 0.962 (mean, layer-22 ESM-2 embeddings, 903 Pfam-35 families)** — the scorer reliably separates a withheld protein family from everything else, on real data, at scale.

---

> **Status: the technical work of this 4-phase capstone is closed on both tracks — the benchmark + go/no-go gate, the Layer-1 EVT scorer, the Layer-3 immune self/non-self layer, and the Phase-4 extension covering all five blueprint layers (Layer 2 ProstT5 at full scale, Layer 4 multi-signal convergence with five axes, Layer 5 coding-structure discrimination with a true-intergenic control), plus the full-scale Genos-m comparison and a leakage-tightened re-test of the Genos-m axis. Track 1 declined to re-freeze Layer 3's detector count, so its frozen default stands (P3-D8). Only manuscript proofreading and submission remain. This is research code from a final-year B.Tech capstone (MPSTME, NMIMS Hyderabad) targeting ACM-BCB 2027, not a packaged library.**

Three embedding arms (protein, genome, structure-aware) feed five independently-designed layers; the convergence check where independent axes reconverge (Layer 4, plus the Layer-1/Layer-3 check) is what lets one signal cross-validate another without shared assumptions.

---

## The problem

Annotation pipelines assign gene function by similarity search, so a gene with no similar characterised sequence gets no function — and that same absence of a known match means there's no ground truth to check whether a proposed "novelty detector" is even right. In this project's own 502-genome benchmark panel, **297,798 of 1,341,100 scanned proteins (22.21%) had zero hit against Pfam 35.0** at the family gathering threshold. Retrospective validation is the only way to manufacture a falsifiable test for a method that claims to find the interesting cases inside that 22%.

---

## How it works

| Layer / Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| Snapshot differencing | Freezes GTDB R207 + Pfam 35.0 as T0, and grades T0-dark sequences against a Pfam-37 net-new-family signal as a T1 proxy for what's been characterised since. |
| ESM-2 embedding arm | Protein-language-model embeddings (650M params, UniRef50 2021_04 cutoff), the leakage-clean headline because its pretraining predates T0. |
| Genos-m embedding arm | Genomic foundation model (4.7B MoE, nucleotide input), run as a leakage-*controlled* comparison — its GTDB R220 pretraining overlaps the benchmark window, so positives are restricted post-R220 for a clean read. |
| Layer 1 — EVT novelty scorer | kNN cosine distance to the characterised reference, calibrated with a Generalized Pareto tail fit so the output is a checked false-flag-rate p-value, not a raw distance. |
| Layer 3 — immune self/non-self | V-detector negative selection over the same embeddings: a repertoire of detectors covers "non-self" space, calibrated so the held-out-self false-flag rate stays under a target α. |
| Layer 2 — structure-aware embedding | ProstT5 (ProtT5-XL fine-tuned on Foldseek 3Di, encoder-only) gives a structure-informed embedding without full 3-D folding — the light ESMFold substitute — scored with the same held-out-family protocol. |
| Layer 4 — multi-signal convergence | Combines independent novelty axes (Layer-1 EVT + an embedding-free genomic-context axis + a sequence-composition axis) and flags high-confidence novelty only where they agree — the "independent lines converge" principle. |
| Layer 5 — coding-structure statistics | Codon-position base bias + k-mer entropy, tested against shuffled and Markov nulls, to confirm the dark genes carry genuine coding structure rather than being spurious/non-coding artifacts. |
| Evaluation harness | Held-out-family AUROC, retrospective Precision@K + lift, and a calibration reliability check — the three metrics frozen before any scorer ran — plus the Layer-1/Layer-3 convergence check and the Layer-4 multi-axis convergence. |

## Results

### 1. The retrospective benchmark clears its go/no-go gate

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Proteins scanned | 1,341,100 |
| Dark-at-T0 | 297,798 (22.21%) |
| Positive-proxy (dark → later characterised) | 4,138 (0.309%) |
| Go/no-go floor (pre-registered) | 50–100 positives |
| Margin over floor | 41–83× |

> **Honest scope:** "characterised by T1" is a Pfam-37 net-new-family proxy, not a full InterProScan run against InterPro-latest as the original design spec called for — narrower coverage, so this count is a floor, not the true number. Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P1-D8](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

### 2. Layer 1 calibrated novelty scorer — 0.962 held-out-family AUROC at full scale

| Representation | AUROC (mean) | AUROC (median) | Families |
|---|---|---|---|
| Last hidden layer (raw) | 0.786 | 0.815 | 903 |
| Layer 22 (raw) | **0.962** | **0.985** | 903 |

GPD tail fit: ξ = 0.0998, β = 0.00586, KS goodness-of-fit p = 0.984.

![Held-out-family AUROC distribution](results/figures/esm2_heldout_auroc_distribution.png)
![Calibration reliability](results/figures/esm2_heldout_calibration.png)

> **Honest scope:** Precision@K lift is *below* 1 at every K tested (0.0× at K=50/100, 0.23× at K=500, 0.50× at K=1000) — this is an expected inversion, not a bug. Positives are near-known genes with intentionally *low* novelty scores, so novelty rank anti-predicts near-term characterisation. Held-out-family AUROC is the certified validation metric; Precision@K is a reported field-level finding, not a pass/fail check. Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P2-D6](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

### 3. Genome-vs-protein comparison — done at full scale, ESM-2 clearly leads

Run on AWS (A10G) over the real 502-genome nucleotide panel — both a matched 300-family comparison against ESM-2, and the full 903-family eval on its own:

| Model | Matched 300-family AUROC (mean / median) | Full 903-family AUROC (mean / median) |
|---|---|---|
| ESM-2 layer 22 (protein) | **0.988 / 0.996** | **0.962 / 0.985** |
| Genos-m layer 9 (genome) | 0.739 / 0.795 | 0.665 / 0.703 |

The genomic FM is a real signal (well above chance) but a distinctly weaker detector — and since Genos-m is the *leakage-controlled* arm (its GTDB R220 pretraining overlaps the benchmark window), it underperforms the leakage-clean protein FM even with a potential leakage advantage, so the ESM-2 headline is not a leakage artifact. A cross-model consistency also emerges: a mid-late layer beats the last layer for *both* models. Note the full-scale numbers are meaningfully lower than the matched-300 ones for both models — family-capping systematically inflates AUROC (more reference members per fold, no small/rare families dragging the average down), so **the 903-family column is the reportable headline, the 300-family column is the fair apples-to-apples comparison.**

> **Honest scope:** the 300-family cap was originally used for a reasonable cloud runtime; the full 903-family Genos-m eval has since been run (2026-09-14, ~75 min on a `g5.xlarge`, ~$1.25). Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P2-D11, P4-D8](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

### 4. Layer 3 immune self/non-self — calibration holds, moderate convergence with Layer 1

| Metric (α = 0.05, 5,000 detectors, PCA-50) | Value |
|---|---|
| Held-out-self flag rate (target ≤ 0.05) | 0.023 |
| Held-out-family AUROC (60 families, original build) | 0.62 mean / 0.53 median |
| Held-out-family AUROC (swept to 20,000 detectors) | 0.86 mean |
| Held-out-family AUROC (measured saturation, ~30,000+ detectors) | 0.89 mean (plateau) |
| Full-scale convergence with Layer 1 (14,138 real dark queries) | Spearman ρ = 0.485 |
| Full-scale non-self flag rate | 11.9% of dark queries — 20.1% of eventual positives vs. 8.6% of still-dark |

![Immune layer sweep summary](results/figures/immune_sweep_summary.png)

> **Honest scope:** as a standalone detector, Layer 3 stays below Layer 1 even at its measured ceiling (0.89 vs. 0.962) — it was designed to *corroborate* Layer 1 via an independently-derived signal, not to beat it. The frozen production config (5,000 detectors) sits at 0.74, below what more detectors would buy. Track 1 reviewed that headroom and **declined to re-freeze**, so the frozen default stands and the paper reports 0.74 as the as-shipped number with 0.89 as a sensitivity result. Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P3-D6, P3-D7, P3-D8](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

### 5. Layer 4 multi-signal convergence — independent axes agree beyond chance, with two reported-but-not-promoted exceptions

Five novelty axes of different kinds — Layer-1 EVT embedding novelty, an embedding-free genomic-context novelty, a sequence-composition novelty, and (added 2026-09-14) Genos-m's and ProstT5's own kNN novelty — combined so a gene is high-confidence novel only where they agree.

| Axis pair | Spearman | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| EVT ~ genomic-context | −0.05 | independent |
| genomic-context ~ composition | +0.01 | independent |
| EVT ~ composition | +0.26 | moderate (ESM-2 encodes some composition) |
| EVT ~ genos-m | +0.15 | weak-moderate |
| genomic-context ~ genos-m | −0.05 | independent |
| composition ~ genos-m | −0.32 | moderate, negative |
| EVT ~ ProstT5 | +0.15 | weak-moderate |
| genomic-context ~ ProstT5 | +0.06 | independent |
| composition ~ ProstT5 | **+0.64** | **not independent** (restates composition) |
| genos-m ~ ProstT5 | −0.43 | moderate, negative |

The first three axes are largely independent, so their convergence is genuine multi-evidence, not one signal restated. The 3-way convergent set is **108 genes = 3.4× more than chance would give** under independence, and evt/context/composition all *deplete* the near-known positives (lifts 1.00×/0.68×/0.26×) — consistent with novelty anti-predicting near-term characterisation.

**Genos-m breaks that pattern: its top-10% novelty *enriches* for positives (lift 1.30×)** — the only axis in the whole project that points this direction.

> **Honest scope, not a 4th independent line of evidence:** Genos-m's pretraining saw GTDB R220, which sits inside this benchmark's T0→T1 window — the same leakage this project controls for everywhere else (P1-D7). Leakage is the leading explanation for the 1.30× lift, so the axis is reported with a caveat, not folded into the "independent lines converge" story. **A direct test (P4-D11) did not confirm it:** re-scoring under the tightest boundary the Pfam releases allow (Pfam 36→37, 2,448 positives full-panel) shrank the positive set 43% but only moved the Genos-m lift from 1.32× to 1.26×, so leakage stays a leading, unconfirmed hypothesis rather than an established cause. The 4-way convergent set (n=35, lift 0.94×) reads close to neutral because Genos-m's enrichment partially cancels the other three axes' depletion.
>
> **ProstT5 as a 5th axis is not independent of composition** (ρ = +0.64) and depletes positives in the same direction (lift 0.28×); the 5-way set is 20 genes at 1.24×. It is reported for completeness, not promoted over the 3-axis headline. Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P4-D1/D2/D4/D8/D10/D11](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

![Layer 4 multi-signal convergence](results/figures/layer4_convergence_summary.png)

### 6. Layer 5 coding-structure — the dark genes are genuinely coding

Codon-position base bias + k-mer entropy on all 34,138 dark genes, tested against each gene's own shuffled and Markov-1 nulls:

| Signal | Value |
|---|---|
| Codon-position base bias (median: real / shuffle / Markov-1) | 0.072 / 0.011 / 0.011 |
| **Coding-vs-noise AUROC** (real vs shuffle / vs Markov-1) | **0.94 / 0.94** |

The dark matter carries genuine reading-frame structure, i.e. these are real ORFs and not spurious calls — a direct answer to the non-coding-artifact risk, and evidence the benchmark rests on real coding sequences.

![Layer 5 coding-structure vs nulls](results/figures/layer5_coding_structure_summary.png)

**True-intergenic control (P4-D9):** streaming real genome assemblies and extracting the sequence between gene calls (44 panel genomes, 81,286 segments) gives a harder, more realistic negative than the artificial nulls: intergenic codon-position bias has median 0.031 (vs 0.011 for shuffle/Markov-1), and coding-vs-true-intergenic AUROC is **0.78**. That is the more trustworthy number to quote; 0.94 is against artificial nulls.

> **Honest scope:** the intergenic control covers 44 of 502 panel genomes (a bounded-cost sample), not the full panel. Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P4-D5, P4-D9](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

### 7. Layer 2 structure-aware embedding (ProstT5) — strong, just below the sequence LM

ProstT5's structure-informed encoder, scored with the same held-out-family protocol on the 300 largest families (6,907 proteins, matched to the ESM-2/Genos-m comparison; an earlier 60-family pilot read slightly higher, 0.960 / 0.972, the same family-capping inflation seen in the other two arms):

| Model (same 300 families) | Held-out-family AUROC (mean / median) |
|---|---|
| ESM-2 layer 22 (sequence) | 0.988 / 0.996 |
| **ProstT5 centered (structure)** | **0.944 / 0.960** |
| Genos-m layer 9 (genome) | 0.739 / 0.795 |

Structure-aware embedding is a strong Pfam-family separator, just below the pure sequence LM and well above the genomic FM — sensible, since Pfam families are homology-defined so a sequence model is naturally strong; structure is complementary, not superior, for family separation.

![Layer 2 ProstT5 vs sequence and genomic arms](results/figures/layer2_prostt5_summary.png)

> **Honest scope:** reported at the matched 300-family scale, not the full 903-family panel that the ESM-2 headline uses. ProstT5 was also embedded for all 34,138 dark queries to serve as Layer 4's 5th axis. Details: [`docs/problems_and_decisions.md` § P4-D6, P4-D10](docs/problems_and_decisions.md).

## Honest limitations

- The T1 "characterised" signal is a Pfam-37 net-new-family proxy, not full InterProScan against InterPro-latest — narrower than the original design spec, so the true positive count is understated, not overstated.
- Genos-m has both a full 903-family eval and a matched 300-family comparison against ESM-2 (both cloud A10G runs); ProstT5 (Layer 2) is reported at the matched 300-family scale, not the full 903-family scale of the ESM-2 headline.
- Genos-m's leakage exposure is only partially controllable: the leakage-tightened re-test (P4-D11) barely moved its enrichment, and no Pfam release beyond 37.0 exists here to test a genuinely clean post-cutoff split, so leakage remains an unconfirmed hypothesis for that axis.
- The retrospective positive set is selection-biased toward near-known genes (characterisation is homology-driven), so Precision@K measures prioritisation value, not "novelty equals characterisability" — stated explicitly, not smoothed over.
- Layer 3 (immune) underperforms Layer 1 as a standalone detector at every detector count tested up to 50,000 (0.89 at its plateau vs 0.962); it's reported as a corroborating signal, not a competing one, and its frozen 5,000-detector default was deliberately kept.
- The full-scale dark-query flagging result uses a stratified 14,138-of-34,138 sample of the dark-query population (all positives, 33% of dark_negatives) — a compute-time scope decision, not a methods one.
- No CI pipeline and minimal automated tests (two smoke/device tests in `tests/`) — correctness is currently established by manual runs logged in `docs/experiment_log.md`, not an automated suite.
- Layer 5's true-intergenic control covers 44 of the 502 panel genomes (a bounded-cost sample), not the full panel; the 0.94 figure against shuffled/Markov-1 nulls is the easier of the two numbers.
- No wet-lab or independent biological validation of any flagged sequence — every result here is a computational prioritisation signal, not a functional claim.
- Developed and run on two personal machines (an M1 Pro laptop and an RTX 4060 laptop, 8GB VRAM), not a reproducible cloud environment — hardware-specific workarounds (fp32-only on MPS, small batch sizes) are documented but not eliminated.

## Data & cost hygiene

The pipeline itself doesn't run live infrastructure, so its operational risk is cloud storage cost, not uptime. **The standing rule (P1-D4): stream public data through the pipeline and persist only derived artifacts — embeddings, labels, manifests — never warehouse the raw GTDB/Pfam downloads.** (The one exception is the project's own static site — see [Live project page](#obscuron) above — a low-cost, low-risk S3-hosted page, not a data-processing dependency.)

> Born from a real bill: an earlier iteration staged the full GTDB R207 protein FASTA set on S3 and racked up roughly $12 over 3 months for ~166GB of duplicated, freely re-downloadable data. If any S3 staging is used for a one-off run, apply a 30–60 day lifecycle expiry:
> ```bash
> aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket <bucket> \
>   --lifecycle-configuration '{"Rules":[{"Expiration":{"Days":30},"Status":"Enabled"}]}'
> ```

The Genos-m comparison used a rented cloud GPU (AWS A10G): the 300-family matched run, then the full 903-family eval plus Genos-m as a 4th convergence axis on 2026-09-14 (~75 min, ~$1.25). ProstT5's full-scale run and the 36→37 boundary scan ran locally. No paid-compute item remains.
